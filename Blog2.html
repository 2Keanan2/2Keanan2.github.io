        <li>
          <strong>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:</strong>
          <p>One of my strengths I believe I have is that I adapt to situations much easier than most people. However one of my limitations is that I get distracted easily if I don't find the task at hand enjoyable and  engaging.</p>

                industry/community representatives:</strong>
              <p>With my stength being abaptation, I don't think this will be of a problem for me going forawrds. However I will speak my mind when it needs to be heard as I am not a push over.</p>
