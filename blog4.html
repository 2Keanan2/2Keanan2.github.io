                    I'm feeling a bit uncertain about what to write for the Sprint 5 blog titled 'Foundations Reflection' because there
                    isn't a clear set of questions to guide my thoughts. When I started the foundations program, I expected it to be more
                    structured and led by teachers, perhaps similar to a traditional textbook approach. However, it turned out to be quite
                    different and more challenging than I anticipated, which caught me off guard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite these challenges, I believe I did relatively well, especially considering my limited background in coding. I
                    managed to adapt and learn throughout the process, which gives me confidence as I continue with the course. Even if I
                    don't end up working in this field, I feel that the skills and knowledge I'm gaining will still be valuable and
                    beneficial for my future endeavors.
